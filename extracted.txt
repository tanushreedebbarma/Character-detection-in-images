Haku, I've just remembered something.
I think it might help you...
when I was little, I dropped my shoe into a river.
When I tried to get it back,
I fell in. I thought I would drown.
but the river carried me to shore.
The river's name was the Kohaku River.
I think that was you!
And your real name is Kohaku River!
