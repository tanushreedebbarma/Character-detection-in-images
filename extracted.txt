Haku, I've just remembered something.
I think it might help you...
when I was little, I dropped my shoe into a river.
When I tried to get it back,
I fell in. I thought I would drown.
but the river carried me to shore.
The river's name was the Kohaku River.
I think that was you!
And your real name is Kohaku River!

"When I have the time, I like to go up to a cabin I have in the
mountains. Sometimes friends will come by to visit me, but I
also like to spend time alone. It reinvigorates me, hiking
those mountain trails. After working on 2 film, it usually
takes half a year for me to recover my mental and physical
balance. I have to set aside time to recuperate. I guess when
you add it all up, I'm not really working that many hours."

- Hayao Miyazaki
